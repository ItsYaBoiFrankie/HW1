//HW pt.2

//To whom it concerns:
//I started this part of the homework two weeks early but have been wrestling with the compilers
//from both Visual Studios and Code::Blocks since, which took up a majority of my time on this hw
//as well as affecting my labs too, making extremely little progress on each attempt,
//in tandem with my 4 day absence with ROTC. I wasn't able to get my program to compile despite
//making office hours with Mr. Rafer both days as well as receiving help through my classmates: 
//Emily Lukshin, Chandler Haukap, and Maria Debroy. Once possible, I plan to meet with my prof
//to help diagnose why I have such trouble through these programs as I try to write my code.

//In all of my files are additional line comments to help explain each process I expect my
//functions to run and I hope that they may be enough to at least earn me points by showing
//you exactly what I expected my code to do, although I could never test it because of
//compiler upon compiler errors.

//Thank you.
